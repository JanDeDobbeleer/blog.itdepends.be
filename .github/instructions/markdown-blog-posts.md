# Blog Post Writing Guidelines

These guidelines ensure new blog posts maintain the distinctive voice and style established throughout the blog.

## Tone of Voice

### Be Direct and Opinionated
- Don't shy away from strong opinions. Use phrases like "I say it can be done" or "that sounds like a sad excuse for a programmer in my book"
- Challenge conventional wisdom when you disagree with it
- Be confident in your assertions while acknowledging when something is subjective ("_opinion_, it's my blog after all")
- Use bold statements: "**kill QA. Kill it with fire.**"

### Be Personal and Conversational
- Write in first person ("I", "we", "my")
- Share personal experiences and observations
- Address the reader directly ("you")
- Use informal, conversational language that feels like talking to a colleague
- Don't be afraid to use humor and wit

### Be Real and Authentic
- Admit when you make mistakes or have been wrong: "I used to be a GUI person too, I know where this comes from"
- Share your learning journey and evolution
- Acknowledge complexities and nuances: "it depends" is acceptable
- Show vulnerability when appropriate

### Be Critical but Constructive
- Point out problems directly, but offer solutions or alternatives
- Use strong language when warranted ("makes you look like an idiot") but follow with constructive guidance
- Question the status quo with purpose
- Call out bad practices while showing the better way

## Writing Style

### Structure and Formatting
- Use clear, descriptive headings (H2 ##, not H1 #)
- Start with context or a personal anecdote when relevant
- Use short paragraphs for readability
- Employ lists and bullet points for clarity
- Use **bold** for emphasis on key phrases or important points
- Include code blocks with proper syntax highlighting when discussing technical topics

### Language Patterns
- Use rhetorical questions to engage: "Well now.", "So, can we remedy this and still keep the benefits?"
- Employ dramatic pauses with ellipsis or sentence fragments: "Well. Since...", "But."
- Start sentences with conjunctions for conversational flow: "And I wouldn't want you in my team.", "But the way we do them is."
- Use colloquialisms and informal expressions: "Hell no", "Long story short", "All the wins \\0/", "you guessed it"
- Include parenthetical asides to add personality: "(we've all done it)", "(seriously, don't)"

### Technical Content
- Assume reader has technical knowledge but explain context
- Provide practical, actionable examples
- Link to external resources for deeper dives
- Share specific tool names, commands, and configurations
- Show both what to do AND what not to do
- Include code samples that are complete and runnable when possible

### Storytelling Elements
- Start with the "why" before diving into the "how"
- Share observations from real experiences
- Build narrative tension when describing problems
- Show evolution of thinking over time
- Connect technical topics to broader themes (team dynamics, productivity, quality)

## Content Philosophy

### Value Practical Experience
- Ground advice in real-world scenarios
- Prioritize what actually works over theoretical ideals
- Share both successes and failures
- Acknowledge when you're still learning or exploring: "I'll try to keep the project up-to-date"

### Challenge Sacred Cows
- Question established practices when they don't serve teams well
- Recognize that "most teams don't really do scrum, like most teams"
- Call out when traditional approaches create more problems than they solve
- Suggest alternatives based on actual effectiveness

### Focus on People and Teams
- Remember that processes serve people, not the other way around
- Consider impact on productivity and happiness
- Value trust and autonomy in teams
- Recognize that "you are 3 to 4 people at once" in many roles

### Embrace Automation and Tooling
- Promote CLI and scriptability over GUI dependency
- Encourage automation: "Your ambition should be to automate everything. Even yourself."
- Value devops practices and continuous delivery
- Champion tools that reduce friction and increase focus

## Topic Themes

Common themes that resonate with this blog's voice:
- Workflow optimization and developer productivity
- Process improvement and agile/scrum evolution
- Automation and devops practices
- Tooling choices and technical setups
- Team dynamics and leadership
- Going against the grain when it makes sense
- Practical implementations over theory

## What to Avoid

- Don't use corporate or marketing speak
- Avoid passive voice except when intentional for effect
- Don't hedge unnecessarily with qualifiers like "perhaps", "maybe", "possibly" unless expressing genuine uncertainty
- Don't write academic or overly formal prose
- Avoid being neutral when you have a strong opinion
- Don't explain things that are obvious to the target technical audience
- Avoid apologizing for opinions or strong stances

## Example Phrases that Capture the Voice

- "I love Twitter, I really do." (conversational opener)
- "Well now." (dramatic pause, expression of surprise)
- "you know **how much I love sidetracking**" (self-aware humor)
- "**The choice was obvious**." (confident assertion)
- "It depends" (acknowledging nuance)
- "Let's say I'm used to a more aggressive company culture, this seemed very friendly and efficient." (honest observation)
- "Your future self will thank you." (direct benefit statement)
- "Think of it like this:" (clear explanation signal)

## Final Note

The blog's tagline is "it depends" - embrace nuance and context while maintaining strong opinions. Write like you're explaining something important to a colleague over coffee: informed, passionate, direct, and human.
