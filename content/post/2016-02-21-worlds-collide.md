At the beginning of this year, the <a href="https://vikingco.com/en/" target="_blank">company I work for</a> got acquired by <a href="http://medialaan.be/" target="_blank">Medialaan</a>, an important player in the Belgian broadcast landscape. While this might seem like just another takeover, it is rather interesting. Two, what initially seem like **completely different worlds** collide, eager to create new opportunities.

I was fortunate enough to go on a guided tour and visit the new colleagues. During the visit we walked into the newsroom where <a href="https://twitter.com/krishoflack?lang=en" target="_blank">Kris Hoflack</a>, editor-in-chief, and <a href="https://twitter.com/elkepattyn?lang=en" target="_blank">Elke Pattyn</a>, local news anchor, gave an explanation of what a regular day looked like in there. It was awesome, and I certainly did not expect that, to recognize something I knew. **They practice scrum**. It all broke down to this, their sprints are 12 hours long, they have a plannings meeting where they distribute the stories together and work towards a product (news broadcast) at the end. There's also a board that shows the progress per story, green indicates good to go, red means it isn't finished yet.

The difference is they never have a nice burndown chart. It always boils down to the last few seconds. And **they manage it**. It's quite amazing because when you watch the news, you rarely realize that. For me, this means there's a lot to be learned from watching how all of this flows towards that end product people expect to uphold the level of quality they are accustomed to.

I don't know if they have any idea what scrum or agile are. All I know is that I can't wait to sit there for a day or two and study how all of that is done. Might be better than 5 years of developer/manager courses combined. So, Kris, Elke, can I invite myself? I promise I'll be invisible ðŸ˜‰
